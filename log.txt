-Started working on basic classes, representing pitches and pitch classes before meeting with Prof. Novak
-Consulted with Professor Novak about what features to have and how to improve on previous implementation of similar tools (3/21/23)
Notes from 3/21/23 meeting:
	User should be able to 
	compute collection normal form, prime form, icv, and forte name of a collection
	give the ability to transpose and invert a collection and then compute the computed information again 
	Z mate: keep a list of the z mates because there's literally like 20 including collections up to hexachords 

	-Inputs:
	have piano keyboard
	For checkboxes: include integer notation AND name 

Implementation of similar concept: 
https://www.mta.ca/pc-set/calculator/pc_calculate.html

Did work before Mar 28:
-Tried to get the piano to work. Couldn't figure out how to get the blocks to look right
-Got the input to update the piano and vice versa. Sometimes have to click twice on the piano to remove a note. Should debug that


Quick meeting with Mr. Novak Mar. 28:
-Use t and e instead of 10 and 11 so we can input without spaces, including on piano keyboard

Decided against this for now. Seems to be a bit complicated, would rather get the app working first. 


Mar. 28 log
-Created regex for integer notation using regex101. Want to match only 0-9 or 10 or 11 separated by spaces.
-Created regex for letter name notation: Capital letter names followed optionally by b, bb, #, and x, separated by spaces. 
-Then we can just OR those together.
-Got piano working perfectly!!!!

Mar 29

-Complement button
-Show me number of common tones at In and Tn 
-Do inversion matrix
-Ask for what In/Tn gives you some number of common tones 
-For Z mate show me the prime form of the z mate
