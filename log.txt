-Started working on basic classes, representing pitches and pitch classes before meeting with Prof. Novak
-Consulted with Professor Novak about what features to have and how to improve on previous implementation of similar tools (3/21/23)
Notes from 3/21/23 meeting:
	User should be able to 
	compute collection normal form, prime form, icv, and forte name of a collection
	give the ability to transpose and invert a collection and then compute the computed information again 
	Z mate: keep a list of the z mates because there's literally like 20 including collections up to hexachords 

	-Inputs:
	have piano keyboard
	For checkboxes: include integer notation AND name 

Implementation of similar concept:
